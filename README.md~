Welcome to my online open lab notebook; home to all my research
scribbles.  This README documents the technical information
about this site. If you're looking for more about what this open
lab notebook is about and why I keep it, consider starting with this
[introduction](http://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/09/28/Welcome-to-my-lab-notebook.html),
or [more about me](http://www.carlboettiger.info).

Notebook Archiving & Data Management
====================================

The lab notebook is written and maintained in plain text (UTF-8) using
markdown. All files are kept in a version managed repository system using
[git](http://git-scm.com/), which provides unique SHA hashes to protect
against corruption. Synchronized backups of the git repository are
maintained on both local and remote servers (RAID 6) to protect against
hardware failures, as well as on the public international software
repository, GitHub [github.com/cboettig](https://github.com/cboettig).
Version history preserves a time-line of changes and protects against
user error file loss.  Archival copies of notebook entries shall be published
annually to [figshare](http://figshare.com) where they will be assigned
DOIs and preserved by the [CLOCKSS](http://www.clockss.org/clockss/Home)
geopolitically distributed 12 node global archive.

Building from source
====================

_NOTE:_ This site is developed for my own needs and may be
difficult to adapt directly to another purpose.  If you are new
to Jekyll, consider starting with a basic Jekyll template such as
[jekyll-bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) which will be considerably
easier to adapt than working from this repository directly.


Site configuration
------------------

Fill in all elements of `_config.yml` appropriately.


API key configuration
---------------------

Several of my custom plugins require authentication credentials to the
relevant API, which are not included when forking this public repository,
for obvious reasons.  These credentials should be stored as secure YAML
files in the project source directory, and added to both `.gitignore`
and the `exclude` list of `_config.yml`.  Currently credentials are only
used for the Twitter and Google Analytics plugins. See the headers of
these plugins for more documentation.
