Notebook Archiving & Data Management
====================================

All files are kept in a version managed repository system using
[git](http://git-scm.com/). Synchronized backups of the git repository are
maintained on both a local server and on the public software
repository, GitHub [github.com/rfarouni](https://github.com/rfarouni).
Version history preserves a time-line of changes and protects against
user error file loss. Copies of notebooks will be published
to [figshare](http://figshare.com) where they will be assigned
DOIs and preserved by the [CLOCKSS](http://www.clockss.org/clockss/Home)
geographically and geopolitically distributed network of redundant archive nodes, located at 12 major research libraries around the world.

Building from source
====================

Note: If you are new to Jekyll, consider starting with a basic Jekyll template such as
[jekyll-bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) which is much easier to modify than this repository.
