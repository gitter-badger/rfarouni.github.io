## Welcome

<img src="assets/img/rick.png" style="float:right; margin: 3px 20px;"/>

I am currently a third-year PhD student in quantitative psychology at the Ohio State University. I mainly interested in the application of statistical methods to the analysis of behavioral and neural data. 

I am also an advocate of reproducible research and open access science. This website contains posts, code and links to several resoucres that I hope you might find useful and interesting.

## My Research Interests

	

* **Quantitative Methods**

		- Multivariate Statistics and Latent Variable Models 
		- Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling 
		- Nonparametric Bayesian Methods

* **Methodological**: 

		* Multivariate Statistical Analysis of fMRI Activation Patterns,
		* Mutlimodal Integration of Functional Neuroimaging Data (e.g.fMRI, EEG, MEG) in a generative Bayesian Hierarchical Model

* **Substantive**:  

		* How information about the sensory environment becomes coded by neural activity in an increasingly abstract hierarchy of representations
		* Invariant Visual Object Recognition
